        <h1>My Experience</h1>
        <p>I have had an amazing experience at this school. They help us learn in a fun way.
            Everyone is motivated by the teachers and the other students. Everyone is sat down
            together so that no one is alone and so students can discuss their queries with
            the others. We get two breaks so we don't feel tired when we do our work.
